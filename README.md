My game, "The Royal Game of Ur", is based off of an ancient board game of the same name. Now, I dont have the time to explain the history of this game in detail, but I do have time to link the Wikipedia article about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur.

    My vision for the game has changed in many ways, but the most significant was the planed two-player mode which was cut due to time constraints. Essentially it would have
worked the same as the base game does now, except the black pieces would have been controlled by another player.

    I am most proud of the AI I made for the black pieces. I designed them to use the same strategy that I play the game with, focusing on one piece at a time and
prioritizing taking pieces. When you play the game though, you might notice that the board commonly becomes crowded by black's pieces, this is due to a bug in the AI where if
one of your pieces is in one of its starting four spaces and the AI is able to land a piece on the same space on its side of the board, it thinks it can take your piece and
moves its piece there. I know how to fix this bug and choose not to for two reasons: it would take a long time to implement the fix, and I think it makes the game more
interesting.
