This was originally made as the final project for a game development class. I don't even remember if it fully works. I don't have access to the original files anymore either, so if anything is broken, it's not getting fixed anytime soon. Maybe I'll make a proper remake at some point on my new engine if I ever decide it's worth it.

It's based on an ancient board game by the same name. It's been so long since I last worked on this I can't remember how to describe it, but the game contains an explanation of the rules, so you should be fine on that front. I never finished the multiplayer feature, so you'll just have to play against the bot.
